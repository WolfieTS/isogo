# Isogo

Have you ever wanted a modern Go frontend?

But the idea of using Go's Wasm compiler with all of its bulk turns you off. (Those massive .wasm file sizes are in double-digit megabytes.)

And you would use TinyGo, but you feel uncomfortable setting up the boilerplate and the idea of moving forward from there scares you because you're not sure when compatibility will break (if TinyGo doesn't compile a certain "thing" correctly).

## Isogo is a hot reloading TinyGo (with Go fallback) boilerplate setup with React and Material-UI already installed and in use for you.
